    <h1>This is the Secret Lore of 💻Better Tech Now</h1>
    <p>
      The creator of Better Tech Now, Dong Badman, was a professional Minecreate player.
      He owned a server called SandwichSMP and played day and night, until his father,
      owner of a bell company Dingaling Calls, tickled Dong Badman's feet until he got
      a job in retail. Dong Badman hated his job, so he, with his two trusted buddies,
      Ryan Gosling and Matheus Retardius, created a company: Better Call Dong.
      <br><br>
      Better Call Dong didn't attract any users, so he decided to give up on his dream
      and work retail for the rest of his miserable life...
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, he decided to get a low taper fade, which MASSIVELY boosted his IQ — crazy!
      With his newfound imagination and knowledge, he renamed his company to 💻Better Tech Now
      and did everything right to make the greatest company of all time.
